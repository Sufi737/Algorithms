#### Concept

A problem is divided into sub-problems of similar type. For every sub-problem the same function is called.

```
function solve(n) {
    if (base_condition) {
        return something
    } else {
        return solve(n) / return solve(n/2) (this can be anything)
    }
}
```

When the function is called again, the current function's state is paused and the next function call is pushed to stack.
Once the base condition is met, function calls are popped from stack one by one

#### Factorial example

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5 * 4!

```js
function factorial(n) {
    if (n==1 || n==0) {
        return 1; //base condition
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n-1);
    }
}

let result = factorial(5);
```

For the first call, when factorial(n-1) call is made, the current function state is paused and one more call is pushed to stack. 

So initially, 

```
{n: 5} (nothing returned and the state is paused)
```

then,

```
{n: 4}
{n: 5} (this is still paused)
```

then 

```
{n: 3}
{n: 4} (this is also paused now)
{n: 5} (this is still paused)
```

this goes on till base condition is met

```
{n: 1} -> returns 1 -> {n: 2} -> returns 2 * 1 -> and so on...
```

#### Recursion can be less efficient

In some cases recursion takes more steps than required. For example, in the case of Fibonacci:

```js
function Fibonacci(n) { //finding nth fibonacci number
    if (n==1 || n==2) {
        return  1;
    } else {
        return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2);
    }
} 
```

In the above case, consider for example we call Fibonacci(5), then Fibonacci(4) and Fibonacci(3) is called. Then for Fibonacci(4) again Fibonacci(3) is called. This results in duplicate calls which we do not require.

This can be solved using <b>memoization</b>, where we store the results and check if that result already exists.

```js
var fib_memo = [];
fib_memo[0] = 0;
fib_memo[1] = 1;
fib_memo[2] = 1;

function Fibonacci(n) { 
    if (fib_memo.indexOf(n) !== -1) {
    	//now we do not need base case as the values are already stored
        return fib_memo[n];
    } else {
        fib_memo[n] = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2);
        return fib_memo[n];
    }
} 
```
