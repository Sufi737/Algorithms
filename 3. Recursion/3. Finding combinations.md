#### Finding array combinations using recursion

Visualise the recursive solution as a binary tree. On every branch we either accept the element or reject it. On every new level we take a new element

Example, ['a', 'b', 'c']

```
                                            []
                     []                                                [a]
            []                [b]                           [a]                    [a, b]
    []            [c]   [b]          [b, c]          [a]            [a, c]   [a, b]          [a, b, c]
 
```
