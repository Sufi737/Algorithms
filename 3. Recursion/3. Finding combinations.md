#### Finding array combinations using recursion

Visualise the recursive solution as a binary tree. On every branch we either accept the element or reject it. On every new level we take a new element

Example, [a, b, c]

```
                                            []

                     []                                               [a]

            []                [b]                           [a]                    [a, b]

    []            [c]   [b]          [b, c]          [a]           [a, c]   [a, b]          [a, b, c]
 
```


#### Implementation

```js
var globalCombinationArray = [];

function arrayCombination(input_array) {

	if (input_array.length === 0) {
    	return [ [] ]; //empty array
    } 

    var firstElement = input_array[0];
    var arrayWithoutFirst = input_array.slice(1);

    var combinationArrayWithoutFirst = arrayCombination(arrayWithoutFirst);

    var combinationArray = []; //this array will store combinations

    for(i=0; i<combinationArrayWithoutFirst.length; i++) {
        combinationArray.push([firstElement, ...combinationArrayWithoutFirst[i]]);
    }

    globalCombinationArray.push([...combinationArrayWithoutFirst, ...combinationArray]);
    return [...combinationArrayWithoutFirst, ...combinationArray];
}

arrayCombination(['a', 'b', 'c']);
console.log(globalCombinationArray);
```
Here, we first take an array without the first element, then make a call on that array recursively. In each call, we append the first element to each combination and return the array of that combination.

For example, [a,b,c] will make a call on [b,c] which will make a call on [c] which will return [c].

This [c] will be appended to [b] which makes [b,c]. This is returned with [b] which makes [b, [b,c], [c]].

Again, [a] is appended to [b] and then [b,c] and then [c] which makes [[a,b], [a,b,c], [a,c], [b], [c], [b,c], [a,c]]. And then finally we append [a].

#### Time Complexity:

In each recursive call, the size of array is reducing by 1. But at the end, we are also doubling the size of the array. Hence, there will be atleast 2^n calls which makes the time complexity as O(2^n)

#### Space Complexity:

In each call we are using n elements of the array, which adds another n-1 elements. Hence space complexity will be O(n*n)
