#### Concept

A priority queue behaves like a queue (FIFO) but each element/node has an inherent value to it. So for the removal operation of a node from the queue, this inherent value will also be considered (for example, nodes from the queue with the highest priority will be removed even when there are not on the front of the queue)

#### Implementation using binary heap

There are many ways to implement a priority queue. One is a binary heap. 

##### Note: Binary heaps are just an implementation of the priority queue. A priority queue is a data structure that represents the queue behaviour and binary heaps are just a way of implementing them.

#### Binary Heaps

A binary heap is a tree based data structure where the parent and child nodes are always ordered. 

Order depends on the type of binary heap. We have 2 types of binary heaps: min heap and max heap.

In min heap, the parent node's value will always be less than the children nodes. In max heap it's reversed.

An example of min heap:

                            5

                7                     10
        
        12           11       

An example of max heap:

                        10

            7                        3

        5         6             2           1



#### But how is this implementing a queue?

The root of a heap is always having either the lowest or the highest value, depending on its type. So for a dequeue operation, we just need to remove the root node, and replace the root node's value with the next lowest or highest value (for another dequeue operation in the future). 

For enqueue operation, we add the node to the heap, but if it invalidates the heap property, we reorder the required nodes in the heap to make it valid.


#### Operations on a binary heap

There are certain things to keep in mind when performing insertion and delete operations on a heap. The heap property should always be valid.

##### Insertion:

When inserting a new node, add the new node to the end (bottom-right). After adding the node, if it invalidates the heap property, we need to perform the bubble-up/swim operation. In this, we keep on swapping the child node with its parent node until the heap is valid

Example: 

                    5

            7             10

        11     12     14


Now we add 3,

                   
                    5

            7             10

        11     12     14       3

The heap is invalid as 3 is a child of 10 and its less than 10. So we swap both.

                   5

            7             3

        11     12     14       10

Still invalid, swap again.

                  3

            7             5

        11     12     14       10

Now its valid.

#### Delete 

For delete, we replace the node being deleted with the end node of the heap, and if after this the heap is invalid, we either perform the bubble-up or sink operation. In sink operation, we replace the parent node value with one of the child node, the child node which has the least value.

Example, 
                  
                  3

            7             5

        11     12     14       10

We want to delete 3. So replace end node, 10, with 3

                  10

             7            5

        11     12     14       

The heap is invalid, so we now have to replace 10 with 5, as 5 is less than 7

                  5

             7            10

        11     12     14 

Now the heap is valid.

#### Complexity analysis

For delete operation, we are going to take at max O(H) time, where H is the height of the heap tree. 

For binary heap, H = logN where N are the number of nodes. 

So time complexity = O(logN) (to the base 2)

The same applies for insertion. 

For a min heap, finding the minimum value node will take O(1) constant time as it will be always the root node.

#### Representing the heap as an array

Start from the root node and proceed from top to bottom and left to right

Example: 

                  3

            7             5

        11     12     14       10

will be represented as [3,7,5,11,12,14,10]

for accessing left and right child nodes, their indexes will be 

left: 2i+1
right: 2i+2

where i is the index of the parent node

#### Javascript implementation

Below is a priority queue implementation using min heap.

The below implementation consists of the following methods:
1. add: Adds a value to the queue
2. swim: If heap is invalid after adding, then swim the node
3. delete: Deletes a node by value
4. sink: Sink operation after deleting a node 
5. dequeue: remove the root node of the heap

```js
class PriorityQueue {
    constructor (size) {
        this.maxSize = size === null ? 1 : size;
        this.queue = [];
    }

    add (value) {
        if (this.queue.length >= this.maxSize) {
            console.log("Queue max size reached");
            return false;
        } else {
            this.queue.push(value);
            let currentIndex = this.queue.length-1;
            //check if this is the root node
            if (this.queue.length !== 1) {
                let parent = this.getParentNode(currentIndex);
                //check for min heap property
                if (value < this.queue[parent]) {
                    //heap invalid
                    this.swim(parent, currentIndex);
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
    }

    swim (parentIndex, childIndex) {
        //swap the nodes
        let temp = this.queue[childIndex];
        this.queue[childIndex] = this.queue[parentIndex];
        this.queue[parentIndex] = temp;
        if (parentIndex === 0) {

            return true;
        } else {
            //check for min heap after swap 
            childIndex = parentIndex;
            parentIndex = this.getParentNode(parentIndex);
            if (this.queue[childIndex] < this.queue[parentIndex]) {
                this.swim(parentIndex, childIndex)
            }
            return true;
        }
    }

    getParentNode (childIndex) {
        // returns the index of teh parent node
        if (childIndex === 0) {
            console.log("Dont pass root node");
            return false;
        }
        let parentIndex = 0;
        if (childIndex%2 !== 0) {
            parentIndex = Math.floor(childIndex/2);
        } else {
            parentIndex = Math.floor((childIndex-1)/2);
        }
        return parentIndex;
    }

    delete (value) {

#### Converting a min heap to max heap

This is easy. Just negate the values of the array and negate them again while returning.
