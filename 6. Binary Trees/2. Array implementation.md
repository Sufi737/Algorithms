#### Array implementation of a binary tree

We can represent a binary tree in an array using the following formulae:

Suppose index of parent node is i (0 based) then,
left child index = 2*i + 1
right child index = 2*i + 2

This is for constructing a tree.

It actually gives us the array if we traverse the tree using Breadth-First search operation

Example:

                3

        5              7

    6       9               12


Equivalent array = [3,5,7,6,9,12]

So for tree with N nodes we can have an array of size N


            3

                     5


[3, null, 5, ]
