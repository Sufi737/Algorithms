#### Concept

If we want to search for a value in a sorted list, we can start from the middle element and compare its value with the target value. If the target value is greater, we search in the right sub-array or else we search in the left sub-array. This is continued till the middle element is equal to the target value.

The pre-requisite for binary search to work is that the list must be sorted.

#### Implementation


```python
def binarySearch(custom_list, target):
    if (target < custom_list[0]) or (target > custom_list[-1]):
        return None
    left = 0
    right = len(custom_list)-1
    middle = len(custom_list)//2

    while (left<=right):
        if (target == custom_list[middle]):
            break
        if (target < custom_list[middle]):
            right = middle
        else:
            left = middle+1

        middle = (left+right)//2
        
    return middle
```

Above we are returning the position of the element in the sorted list if present otherwise None is returned
