#### Fenwick tree concept

Fenwick trees allows to calculate prefix sums of an array of integers effectively.

If we want to find prefix sum we have to traverse the entire array and store the prefix sum as current element value + previous sum

Example: for list [1,2,3,4,5]

prefix sum will be [0,1,3,6,10,15]

If we want to find the sum of range, let's say from numbers 2 to 4, we can traverse the prefix sum list and calculate them as 10-1 = 9

But if we want to update this list, even a single value, we have to update the entire prefix sum list.

This is resolved by Fenwick tree

#### Fenwick tree construction

Fenwick trees are visualised as a tree based data structure, but we don't have to actually implement them as a tree

In fenwick trees, instead of storing the sum of elements of all previous values, we only need to store the sum of a certain range.

This range is dependent on the position of the least significant bit (LSB) of the binary representation of the current element's position

for example, 1's binary value is 0001. It has the LSB at position 1, which means it will store the sum of only 1 element before it. As it is the first element we can ignore it

For position 2, 0010, LSB is at position 2, and so it is responsible to store sum of 2 elements before it with itself
For position 3, 0011, LSB is at position 1, so it will store sum of only 1 element before it along with itself
For position 4, 0100, LSB is at position 3, so it will store sum of 3 elements before it along with itself
For position 8, 1000, LSB is at position 4, so it will store sum of 4 elements before it along with itself

We can visualise the above as something like below:

8 - 1000, value=6           | sum=6+6+12+2=26
7 - 0111, value=2  |        | sum=2, 8 is responsible add 2 to 6
6 - 0110, value=9     |     | sum=9+3=12, 8 is responsible, add 12 to 6
5 - 0101, value=3  |  |     | sum=3, 6 is responsible, add 3 to 9
4 - 0100, value=-1      |   | sum=-1+6+1=6, 8 is responsible for this so add 6 to 6
3 - 0011, value=1  |    |   | sum=1, 4 is responsible for this so add 1 to -1
2 - 0010, value=5    |  |   | sum=5+1=6, 4 is responsible for this so add 6 to -1
1 - 0001, value=1  | |  |   | sum=1, 2 is responsible for this so add 1 to 5

As we traverse through the array we do the following steps:

1. Find which element is responsible for the current element
2. Add the current element value to the element responsible

So for the above list we get someting like [1, 6, 1, 6, 3, 12, 2, 26]

#### Time complexity for construction

The time complexity is O(N*logN) as we are traversing the entire list for the construction and also in each step we are updating the elements responsible for storing the sum which takes logN time

The construction time complexity is greater than a prefix sum array but if we want to update the array it will take lesser time


#### Getting sum within a range

To find the sum for a given range, we cascade down the tree and add the values which are responsible. For example, to find sum of values upto position 7. We add tree[7] + tree[6] + tree[4] and we are done 

In the above tree we can verify this->12+2+6=20 is the sum of the list from position 1 to 7

If we want to find the sum within a range lets say [i,j] we first find the sum result of [1,j] and [1,i) not inclusive. Then we subtract both the values

For example find the sum within range [3,7], find [1,7] which is 20 as calculate above

For [1,3) it will be tree[2] = 6 

[1,7] - [1,3)  = 20-6 = 14 which is the correct answer

One more example, [5,8] = [1,8] - [1,5)

[1,8] -> tree[8] = 26

[1,5) -> tree[4] = 6

26-6 = 20 which is the sum for the range [5,8] if we see the list

We are only using two elements to find the sum within a range

#### Time complexity for getting sum

As we are only reading the elements that are responsible for storing the sum, number of elements reduce by 2 in each step and hence it is O(logN)


#### Updating an element

To update an element also we only update the ones which are responsible for the current element and keep on repeating this untill all the required elements are updated.

For example, if we are updating the 4th element, we only need to update the 4th and the 8th

#### Time complexity for update

O(logN) as we only need to update the values of elements responsible. This is lesser than the prefix sum array for which it takes O(N) time complexity
