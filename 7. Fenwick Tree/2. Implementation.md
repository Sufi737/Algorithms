#### Finding the elements responsible using LSB

In a fenwick tree we need to find which elements are responsible for storing the sum of current element's value. This is done using the position of the Least Significant Bit. 

This is a very simple operation as follows:

    NextPosition = CurrentPosition + (CurrentPosition & -CurrentPosition)

We only need to do a bitwise AND operation of the current position with the negative value of itself.

For example, we have 1 as the current position -> 1 & -1 = 1 and so we will update the current position as 1+1=2(based on above formula)
That is the next element we need to update is 2, which is correct.

The & operator works by providing the position of the last set bit 

Let x be the current position and x be represented as a1b (where 1 is our LSB)

Then -x = a`0b+1 (taking 2's complement -> negating and adding 1)

If we know that LSB is 1 then all bits to the right must be 0s only

So for x -> a1(0...0)

and for -x -> a'0(1...1)+1 -> a'1(0...0)

So doing x & -x is equivalent to below

        a   1    b
    &   a'  1    b

Which is actually

        a   1    (0...0)
    &   a'  1    (0...0)
   -------------------------
    (0...0) 1    (0...0)

As a result, we will only get the LSB as the answer, on which we are dependent on finding the next position to update or read

#### Construction

Traverse the entire list and perform update operation on the required elements

```python
def constructFenwickTree (custom_list):
    fenwick_tree=[i for i in custom_list]
    for index in range(1, len(custom_list)+1):
        #find the next responsible element
        nextIndex = index + (index & -index)
        #update the responsible element
        if (nextIndex <= len(custom_list)):
            fenwick_tree[nextIndex-1] += fenwick_tree[index-1]

    return fenwick_tree
```

#### Updating the tree

For updating we only need to update those points which are responsible for storing the current element's sum

```python
def pointUpdate (position, fenwick_tree, toAdd):
    if (position > len(custom_list)+1):
        return fenwick_tree
    fenwick_tree[position-1] += toAdd
    nextIndex = position + (position & -position)
    pointUpdate(nextIndex, fenwick_tree, toAdd)
    return fenwick_tree
```

Here it is making a recursive call with the next element which needs to be updated

#### Range queries

For range sum queries we have to cascade down the tree to add the sums. We can also start from 1st position and go up and add values of elements that are responsible.

```python
def prefixSum(position, fenwick_tree):
    sum=0
    while position > 0:
        sum += fenwick_tree[position-1]
        position -= (position & -position)
    return sum

def rangeQuery (start, end, fenwick_tree):
    return prefixSum(end, fenwick_tree) - prefixSum(start-1, fenwick_tree)
```


Only this much code is required to construct a fenwick tree, do point updates and do range queries as well.
