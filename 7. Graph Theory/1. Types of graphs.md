### Types of Graphs

#### 1. Undirected graph

The edges have no orientation. Edge (u,v) is same as edge (v,u)

Example, roads between cities

#### 2. Directed graph

Here the direction of the edge makes it a unique edge. Edge (u,v) is NOT same as edge (v,u)

This also means that an edge from node u to node v is present but from v to us might not.

#### 3. Weighted graphs

Here the edges are associated with a cost to travel from node u to node v

Usually denoted as (u, v, w) where w is the cost

#### 4. Directed acyclic graphs

These are directed graphs with no cycles

#### 5. Bipartite graphs

These are graphs whose vertices can be divided into groups U,V such that every edge connects between U and V

#### 6. Complete graphs

Every node connects to every other node.


#### Note: Trees are also a unique type of graph which we can say are unidirectional from root to leaf
