### Data structures to represent graphs

#### 1. Adjacency matrix

Graphs can be represented in a matrix where every cell in the matrix represents the path cost to travel between two nodes.

If M is a matrix then M<sub>i</sub><sub>j</sub> denotes the cost to travel from node i to node j

Advantages:
1. Edge weight lookup takes constant O(1) time
2. For dense graphs these are space efficient where there are a lot of edges

Disadvantages:
1. Takes O(N<sup>2</sup>) space
2. Iterating all edges takes O(N<sup>2</sup>) time

#### 2. Adjacency list

We can represent graphs as a map

Example,

A -> [(B,4) (C,1)] this means to travel from node A to node B costs 4 units and to C costs 1 unit

Advantages:
1. Space effecient for sparse graphs
2. Iterating all edges is efficient

Disadvantages:
1. Not suitable for dense graphs
2. Edge weight lookup is in worse case O(E) where E is the number of edges

#### 3. Edge list

We can also simply have an unordered list of edges in the form (u, v, w)

Advantages and disadvantages same as adjacency list

These are rarely implemented
