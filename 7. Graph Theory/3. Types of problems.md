### Common graph theory problems

#### Questions to ask before solving a problem

These questions help in identifying what type of problem it is:

1. Is the graph directed or undirected?
2. Are the edges of the graph weighted?
3. Is the graph sparse or dense?
4. What type of data structure representation will be the best? It can either be adjacency matrix, edge list or adjacency list


#### Shortest path problem

Given a weighted graph find the shortest path from given two nodes

Algorithms: BFS, Djikstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall and others

#### Connectivity

Given a graph find if there exists a path between two given nodes

Algorithms: Union find or any search algorithm like DFS

#### Negative cycles

Given a weighted graph find if it has any weighted cycles i.e. find if the sum of the weights of the paths in a cycle results in negative

Algorithms: Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall

#### Strongly connected components

Given a directed graph find if there are strongly connected components. Strongly connected components are cycles where every node can reach every other node in the same cycle

Algorithms: Tarjan's and Kosaraju's algorithm

#### Travelling Salesman problem

Salesman has to travel a list of cities. Find the shortest path that covers all the cities

Algorithms: Held-Karp, branch and bound

#### Minimum spanning tree

This is a subset of graph which covers all the nodes without cycles and also having minimum path cost

Algorithms: Kruskal's, Prim's and Boruvka's algorithm

#### Network flow

Given a network where each edge represents the max capacity it can handle, find the max flow for a given network considering the source is infinite

For example, roads with cars can be represented with edges where the weight of the edge denotes the number of cars that road can handle

Algorithms: Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp & Dinic's algorithm
