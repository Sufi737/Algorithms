### Implementing a graph

#### Using adjacency list

In adjacency list we store each edge as a list

For example if 1 is connect to 2 and 3 we will have a dictionary as 

[1] => [2,3]

We can also associate weights by storing the list using tuples

[1] => [[2,100], [3,150]]


```python
from typing import DefaultDict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = DefaultDict(list)

    def addEdge(self, u, v, w):
        newEdge = [v, w]
        self.graph[u].append(newEdge)
```

And we can create a graph and add edges as follows:

```python
newgraph = Graph()
newgraph.addEdge(1, 4, 7)
newgraph.addEdge(1, 3, 3)
newgraph.addEdge(3, 4, 9)
newgraph.addEdge(3, 5, 1)
newgraph.addEdge(2, 5, 2)
newgraph.addEdge(5, 6, 11)
```
