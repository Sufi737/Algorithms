### Depth First Search

This algorithm is used to search for nodes and edges in a graph or a tree.

For a graph we have to take care of cycles when using DFS technique. In case of a cycle, we "backtrack"

In this technique, we keep on traversing the graph or tree arbitrarily and mark the visited nodes. If we reach a visited node again, we backtrack and traverse a different path. If all nodes are visited we bactrack till the start node is reached.


#### Implementation approach

Depends upon the data structure used

Basic idea:

1. Start with a root node
2. For each node visited mark it as visited
3. Continue the same with the connected adjacent nodes recursively till all nodes visited


It might be possible that there are islands in a graph. Here we start the dfs again with a new root node


#### Implementation for adjacency list

Using the same class as before, adding two more methods DFS and DFSUtil

```python
from typing import DefaultDict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = DefaultDict(list)

    def addEdge(self, u, v, w):
        newEdge = [v, w]
        self.graph[u].append(newEdge)

def DFSUtil(self, node, visited):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbour in self.graph[node]:
            if neighbour[0] not in visited:
                self.DFSUtil(neighbour[0], visited)


    def DFS(self):
        visited = set() #set ensures elements are unique, list doesn't work here

        for node, neighbours in list(self.graph.items()):  #necessary to cast items as a list
            if node not in visited:
                self.DFSUtil(node, visited)
```

#### Implementation for adjacency matrix

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.graph = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]


    def addEdge(self, u, v, w):
        self.graph[u-1][v-1] = w
        self.graph[v-1][u-1] = w

    def DFS(self, node, visited):
        visited.add(node+1)
        
        for i in range(len(self.graph[0])):
            if ((i+1) not in visited) and self.graph[node][i] > 0:
                self.DFS(i, visited)


newgraph = Graph(8)
newgraph.addEdge(1, 4, 7)
newgraph.addEdge(1, 3, 3)
newgraph.addEdge(3, 4, 9)
newgraph.addEdge(3, 5, 1)
newgraph.addEdge(2, 5, 2)
newgraph.addEdge(5, 6, 11)
newgraph.addEdge(7, 8, 3)

print(newgraph.graph)

visited = set()
for i in range(0, 8):
    if i not in visited:
        newgraph.DFS(i, visited)
```
