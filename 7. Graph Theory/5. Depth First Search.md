### Depth First Search

This algorithm is used to search for nodes and edges in a graph or a tree.

For a graph we have to take care of cycles when using DFS technique. In case of a cycle, we "backtrack"

In this technique, we keep on traversing the graph or tree arbitrarily and mark the visited nodes. If we reach a visited node again, we backtrack and traverse a different path. If all nodes are visited we bactrack till the start node is reached.


#### Implementation approach

Depends upon the data structure used

Basic idea:

1. Start with a root node
2. For each node visited mark it as visited
3. Continue the same with the connected adjacent nodes recursively till all nodes visited


It might be possible that there are islands in a graph. Here we start the dfs again with a new root node
