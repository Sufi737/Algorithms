### Breadth First Search

In BFS, we visit a node, then visit all the neighbour nodes and repeat this process until all the nodes are repeated

#### Implementation

For adjacency list we add the neighbour nodes in the queue and repeat the process till the queue is empty

```python
from typing import DefaultDict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self, nodeCount):
        self.graph = DefaultDict(list)
        self.nodeCount = nodeCount

    def addEdge(self, u, v, w):
        newEdge = [v, w]
        self.graph[u].append(newEdge)

    def BFS(self, start):
        visited = [0]*self.nodeCount
        queue = [start]

        while queue:
            current_node = queue.pop()
            print(current_node)
            for neighbour in self.graph[current_node]:
                if visited[neighbour[0]-1] == 0 and neighbour[0] not in queue:
                    queue.append(neighbour[0])
                    visited[neighbour[0]-1] = 1

```

For adjacency matrix if we find the value to be greater than 0 in the matrix then we add that node to the queue

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.graph = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]
        self.nodeCount = n

    def addEdge(self, u, v, w):
        #considering bidirectional graph
        self.graph[u-1][v-1] = w
        self.graph[v-1][u-1] = w

    def BFS(self):
        visited = [0]*self.nodeCount
        queue = [0]
        while queue:
            current_node = queue.pop()
            print(current_node+1)
            visited[current_node] = 1
            for neighbour in range(0, len(self.graph[0])):
                if self.graph[current_node][neighbour] > 0 and visited[neighbour]!=1:
                    queue.append(neighbour)
                    visited[neighbour] = 1
```
