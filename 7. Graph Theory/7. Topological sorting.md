### Topological sorting

Topological sorting allows us to express the dependencies between elements by using a graph. For this the graph has to be acyclic and directed. Trees are also valid.

For example, consider there are modules in software development life cycle that are dependent on each other (module X is dependent on module Y). Such a relation can be expressed via a graph. 

With the help of topological sort we can print out the nodes in an order which provides us the modules to be developed in sequence.

Note: Topological orderings are not unique. There can be multiple orderings that correctly express the dependencies

One more way of defining it would be if there is a directed edge from node A to node B, then node B cannot come before node A in the ordering.

The first node in the ordering cannot have an incoming edge as well.

#### Algorithmic approach

1. Start with any random node
2. For each node, perform DFS for it's neighbouring node.
3. Perform DFS recursively till there is no node to reach. Then add the current node to the stack
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 till all nodes are added to stack.
5. Print the stack


#### Implementation

```python
from collections import defaultdict
 
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)
        self.V = vertices 
 
    def addEdge(self, u, v):
        self.graph[u].append(v)

    def DFS(self, node, stack, visited):
        #mark the node as visited
        visited.add(node)

        #recursively call the DFS
        for neighbour in self.graph[node]:
            if neighbour not in visited:
                self.DFS(neighbour, stack, visited)


        #adding the node to stack at the end of DFS
        stack.append(node)

    def topologicalSort(self):
        stack = []
        visited = set()

        for node, edge in list(self.graph.items()):
            if node not in visited:
                self.DFS(node, stack, visited)
                    

        #print the stack
        while stack:
            print(stack.pop())


graph = Graph(6)
graph.addEdge(5, 2)
graph.addEdge(5, 0)
graph.addEdge(4, 0)
graph.addEdge(4, 1)
graph.addEdge(2, 3)
graph.addEdge(3, 1)

graph.topologicalSort()
```
